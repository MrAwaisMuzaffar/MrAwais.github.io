 <p>The generator is made up of the words of the 6 LotR & Hobbit
     movies' extended versions. These words are separated into 3 
     categories: regular words, proper nouns and actual quotes from
      the films, the latter two are hand-curated. We use a combination 
      of these 3 dictionaries to generate texts for every occasion.    
    </p>
    <p class="right">
    Technology-wise, extracting the words from the subtitle files was
    done in Python. The website itself and the random text generation 
    was written in PHP. We have a bunch of Javascript functions to 
    handle formatting and clipboard operations.</p>
